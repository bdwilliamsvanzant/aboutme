After 5 years this is my last year at LCSC. Originally I wanted to become a chemical engineer but that would of required me to move to study at U of I. Wanting to remain local my friend suggested that I try programming. Half way through my Computer Science degree I chose to do Web Development as my division which I found out last semester that I will graduate with a bachelors degree for Web Development along with my Computer Science degree.

My goal this semester is to create a complete app to then generate some passive income from the app store. I'm stil deciding on if there will be a free version with ads with a premium version that costs $1 or just keep it free with ad revenue.

In my free time I play DnD 5e. We just started a new campaign where I am playing a Druid Barbarian multiclassed Half-elf which leads to some adventures.
